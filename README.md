# DS-Academy-EDA
This EDA project uses New York Census and MTA Subway data sets to explore socio-economic factors affecting subway ridership in New York City. We analyze the data to uncover insights about subway usage patterns, demographics, and more. This project was created as part of the WomanTechWomanYes initiative to support and promote women in technology.
